            <h2 class="blog-title">May 2024 - Another Month, Another Disaster</h2>
            <p class="blog-content">Well, would you look at that, another month has passed, and life is still a rollercoaster. This month, I managed to mess up making my toast ever signle day, got hacked by KinitoPET, and lost my 2FA to one of my accounts. Oh, and did I mention I got banned for being cyberbullied? Yeah, that happened. Anyway, here's to hoping next month is slightly less of a mess. Cheers.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">In addition to the usual gaming fails, I also had some epic fails in real life. Let's just say I tried cooking and ended up with 2 half burned burger buns. Classic one.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">On the bright side, I discovered a new game that I suck at. Well atleast I didn't burn another piece of toast. But hey, at least it's a new game. even though I haven't won yet, I remain being Star-Blob.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">As the month comes to a close, I find it hard to even post, but I will start posting again this month. Here's to embracing the chaos and looking forward to another month of gaming adventures. Oh, and speaking of adventures, I'm seriously considering <a href="#">Making my own game</a>. Maybe it's for the better, or worse, i am going to try and develop a game with this visual coding site called
<a href="#">GDVELOP</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">April 2024 - A Month of Gaming Fails</h2>
            <p class="blog-content">Continuing from where we left off in May, April was no less of a disaster. In my ongoing quest for gaming domination, I decided to delve deeper into the world of competitive gaming. Needless to say, it was a disaster waiting to happen. My attempts at mastering the game fell flat, and I found myself at the bottom of the leaderboard more times than I care to admit.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">To add insult to injury, I also managed to rage quit and break my controller in the process. I blame the game mechanics and my lack of skills, but deep down, I know it's just another chapter in the book of my ongoing gaming misadventures.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">As April bids farewell, I reflect on the absurdity of my gaming life and embrace the chaosthat is my gaming journey. Here's to hoping May brings fewer epic fails and more opportunities for epic wins. But let's be real, it's probably just going to be more of the same. Until next time, stay epic, my gaming friends.</p>
