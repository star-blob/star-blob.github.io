            <h2 class="blog-title">May 2024 26th - Another Day, Another Shitstorm</h2>
            <p class="blog-content">Oh, for fuck's sake, listen up. So, here's the deal. I'm cruising through my day, right? Then suddenly, I'm knee-deep in a pile of bullshit. Talking to this "Skibid Toilet Content creator" or whatever the hell they call themselves, and next thing I know, we're in the middle of a heated argument with their sorry-ass buddies. Then, out of nowhere, one of those dipshits decides to dox someone or some crap like that. I couldn't care less, really. And to top it off, this douchebag starts calling me an 8-year-old or some bullshit like that, all because I called out one of them for acting like a freaking 9-year-old. Can you believe that shit? Anyway, if you wasted your precious time reading this garbage, well, congrats, you've officially joined the club of dumbasses. Catch you later, losers. Signed, the one and only, star-blob dipshit.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">To Expose Someone - Part 1: Bl0xernewb - Friend, enemy...</h2>
            <p class="blog-content">Alright, gather 'round, you pathetic losers, 'cause it's storytime with your favorite dipshit narrator, yours truly. Today's episode? The epic tale of Bl0xernewb, the douchebag extraordinaire.
</p>
            <p class="blog-content">So, picture this: I'm innocently scrolling through the depths of the internet, minding my own business, when suddenly, I stumble upon a leaked animatic featuring a famous person's character. Being the creative genius that I am, I decide to put my own spin on it and create something truly legendary. But oh no, here comes Bl0xernewb, like a rabid dog foaming at the mouth, accusing me of stealing his precious artwork. Yeah, right, like anyone would want to steal his garbage.

</p>
            <p class="blog-content">But wait, it gets better. This motherfucker decides to pull some sneaky shit with a fake "duolingo anti-piracy screen" in a sad attempt to grab my IP. Nice try, dipshit, but you're about as stealthy as a drunk elephant in a china shop.

</p>
            <p class="blog-content">Now, let's talk about his hobbies, shall we? Not content with just being a drama queen, Bl0xernewb also has a thing for making body pillows of underage video game characters. Yeah, you heard that right. And to top it all off, he's binge-watching adult content like it's going out of style. Real classy, bro, real fuckin' classy.
</p>
        <p class="blog-content">So, to sum it up: Bl0xernewb is a lying, cheating, IP-grabbing, underage-pillow-making, drama-loving piece of human garbage. Stay tuned for more thrilling episodes of "To Expose Someone," where we'll dive even deeper into the cesspool of human depravity. Until next time, keep being dipshits and loners, my fellow drama junkies
<p class="blog-content">But wait, there's more! We were supposed to collaborate on a Friday Night Funkin' mod, but guess what? This spineless coward bails on me halfway through like a scared little puppy, leaving me to pick up the pieces. And then, to add insult to injury, he has the audacity to accuse me of stealing his vectors. Yeah, 'cause that makes sense.

            <h2 class="blog-title">May 2024, week 3 - Another week, another fuckin' fail.</h2>
            <p class="blog-content">Wow, shocker, right? Yesterday was a total shitshow. I was hanging with my one and only "friend" at school (because, let's be real, I'm a pathetic loner with no social life), and we were dicking around, throwing insults like "You get no bitches" back and forth. But then, outta nowhere, this dude drops a savage comeback that leaves me reeling. Can't even fuckin' deal with it, man. And to top it off, I managed to spill chips all over the damn floor. Smooth move, dumbass.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">So, I decided to jump on the hype train for the new "The Classic" Roblox event, thinking it'd give me something to distract my sorry ass. But guess what? I breezed through that shit in just two goddamn days. If that ain't a limp dick move, I don't know what the fuck is.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">But hold up, it ain't all rainbows and sunshine. I made the genius decision to quit game development because, surprise surprise, I'm a lazy sack of shit with no ambition. Ain't got time for that grind, you know?</p>
            <p class="blog-content">As the week's grinding down, I'm finding it impossible to focus on anything 'cause I can't get that epic comeback outta my head. Oh, and to add insult to injury, I burnt the fucking toast. Like, seriously? Can my life get any more pathetic?</p>
        </div><div class="blog-post">
            <h2 class="blog-title">May 2024 - Another Month, Another Disaster - Discontinued</h2>
            <p class="blog-content">Well, would you look at that, another month has passed, and life is still a rollercoaster. This month, I managed to mess up making my toast ever single day, got hacked by KinitoPET, and lost my 2FA to one of my accounts. Oh, and did I mention I got banned for being cyberbullied? Yeah, that happened. Anyway, here's to hoping next month is slightly less of a mess. Cheers.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">In addition to the usual gaming fails, I also had some epic fails in real life. Let's just say I tried cooking and ended up with 2 half burned burger buns. Classic one.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">On the bright side, I discovered a new game that I suck at. Well atleast I didn't burn another piece of toast. But hey, at least it's a new game. even though I haven't won yet, I remain being Star-Blob.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">As the month comes to a close, I find it hard to even post, but I will start posting again this month. Here's to embracing the chaos and looking forward to another month of gaming adventures. Oh, and speaking of adventures, I'm seriously considering <a href="#">Making my own game</a>, who knows?</p>
            <p class="blog-content">Until next time, stay weird and stay chaotic, fellow gamers!</p>
